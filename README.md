# UFO Sightings Search

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the North American eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

This site contains a table dynamically based upon a dataset stored on the server. In `UFO-level-1`, users can filter the table data by `date`. In `UFO-level-2`, users can search the data by `date`, `city`, `state`, `country`, and `UFO shape`. Users can also visualize sightings by date or state of occurrence.
