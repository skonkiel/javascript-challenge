# UFO Sightings Search

This project collates UFO data into a searchable database using Javascript.

This site contains a table dynamically based upon a dataset stored on the server. In [`UFO-level-1`](https://skonkiel.github.io/javascript-challenge/UFO-level-1/index.html), users can filter the table data by `date`. 

In [`UFO-level-2`](https://skonkiel.github.io/javascript-challenge/UFO-level-2/index.html), users can search the data by `date`, `city`, `state`, `country`, and `UFO shape`. Users can also visualize sightings by date and state. 

This site was built using HTML, vanilla JavaScript, CSS, D3.js, and Plotly/JS.
